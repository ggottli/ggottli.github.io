            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for approximately 28% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions in 2022 (United States Environmental Protection Agency). Road transport, consisting of passenger cars, buses, and freight vehicles, produced nearly 75% of total transport emissions, with passenger vehicles (cars and buses) responsible for around 45% of these emissions (Ritchie & Roser, 2020). The heavy reliance on fossil fuels, particularly gasoline and diesel, has made the transportation sector a major cause of climate change. Projections show that efforts in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C mean reducing emissions from the combustion and production of fuels and electricity for transport by at least 80% from today’s levels by 2050, and the largest part of this reduction needs to come from passenger cars.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Beyond contributing to global warming, emissions from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles pose severe risks to human health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution from vehicle exhaust is one of the leading causes of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and premature deaths worldwide.</p>
            <p>One of the most promising solutions to decarbonize transportation is the electrification of passenger vehicles. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) offer a cleaner alternative by significantly reducing tailpipe emissions and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels. Over the past decade, advances in battery technology, charging infrastructure, and policy incentives have positioned electric vehicles (EVs) as a scalable and viable solution for reducing transportation-related emissions. However, questions remain unanswered regarding the practicality, scalability, and long-term sustainability of this transition.</p>
            <p>Electrifying passenger vehicles offers a promising pathway to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. By significantly lowering tailpipe emissions and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels, EVs have the potential to transform the transportation sector into a cleaner, more sustainable system. While achieving widespread EV adoption requires addressing key challenges such as battery production impacts, charging infrastructure, and equitable access, the benefits of electrification, when supported by renewable energy, outweigh the drawbacks, making EVs a critical component of a low-carbon future.</p>

        <section class="pros">
            <h2>The Proposed Strategy – Pros</h2>
            <p>Our research finds that aligning with Paris Agreement targets will require phasing out sales of new ICEVs by the year 2030-2035. However, the transition to BEVs need not wait for future power sector improvements. BEVs already have lower life-cycle emissions compared to similar gasoline powered cars, even in geographies where a large proportion of electricity is generated using coal and other non-renewable methods (Bieker, 2021).</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="figure2.png" alt="GHG Comparison">
                <figcaption>Figure 2: Even in countries with a low proportion of electricity generated through renewables, BEVs have lower life cycle GHG emissions compared to ICEVs (Bieker, 2021).</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In Europe, medium-size EVs have 66-69% lower emissions than gasoline cars in 2021, with projections to 74-77% by 2030. In the U.S., the reduction is 60-68% in 2021, expected to reach 62-76% by 2030. These figures vary by region, with cleaner electricity grids amplifying the benefits. This advantage comes from zero tailpipe emissions during use, offsetting higher manufacturing emissions, especially for batteries.</p>
            <p>A study conducted by Cotes also found that the total carbon footprint of ICE vehicles quickly overtake that of the EVs after 15,000 miles (24,140 km) of driving. It takes a typical EV about one year in operation to achieve "carbon parity" with an ICE vehicle. If the EV draws electricity from a coal/fired grid, however, the catchup period stretches to more than five years. If the grid is powered by carbon/free hydroelectricity, the catchup period is only about six months (Cotes, 2023).</p>
            <p>Additionally, BEVs significantly reduce urban air pollution by eliminating tailpipe emissions, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which are major contributors to poor air quality in cities. A study from the Keck School of Medicine of USC found that in California, for every additional 20 BEVs per 1,000 people, asthma-related emergency room visits dropped by 3.2% between 2013 and 2019.</p>
            <p>The American Lung Association’s "Driving to Clean Air" report projects that a nationwide shift to zero-emission vehicles by 2035 could prevent 89,300 premature deaths, 2.2 million asthma attacks, and 10.7 million lost workdays by 2050, yielding $978 billion in public health benefits from 2020 to 2050.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="cons">
            <h2>The Proposed Strategy – Cons</h2>
            <p>While BEVs represent a promising path toward decarbonizing transportation, several significant challenges must be addressed before widespread adoption can be achieved. One limitation is that EVs currently have higher initial purchase prices compared to ICEVs, largely due to the cost of batteries. The batteries used in EVs can cost around ten times more than those in gas-powered vehicles, driving up retail prices and limiting accessibility for some consumers (Chapter 10: Transport).</p>
            <p>Another issue is the high reports of something known as “range anxiety”, which is the fear of running out of battery without access to a charger. Most BEVs today have a range of about 200-400 km, which might be sufficient for local driving but not sufficient for long road trips (iea, n.d.). Additionally, there is a limited availability of charging stations, especially in rural and underserved areas.</p>
            <p>EVs also require longer to charge. While ICEVs take under five minutes to refuel, charging up an EV can take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on where the vehicle is being charged (Oreizi, 2021).</p>
            <p>Although EVs eliminate tailpipe emissions, the environmental cost of producing lithium-ion batteries remains a major issue. Mining for lithium, cobalt, and nickel not only emits greenhouse gases but also disrupts ecosystems and raises ethical concerns due to poor labor conditions in certain mining regions.</p>
            <p>While the drawbacks of EVs raise valid concerns, many of these issues are being addressed through rapid technological advancement. Solid-state batteries and lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) chemistries offer promising alternatives that are more sustainable and less resource-intensive (Jose et al., 2025).</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="figure3.png" alt="Battery Price Trends">
                <figcaption>Figure 3: Battery prices have steadily fallen from ~$1500/kWh in 2010 to $115/kWh in 2024 (McCarthy, 2024).</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Ultimately, these improvements suggest that the cons of EVs are largely transitional. As innovation continues, the barriers to EV adoption will diminish.</p>

            <h2>Successful Implementations</h2>
            <p>Electric vehicles have emerged as a critical tool in the global effort to combat climate change, and several countries have already demonstrated how strategic policy implementation can dramatically accelerate EV adoption. Norway, for example, leads the world in EV market share, with over 80% of new vehicles sold in 2022 being electric.</p>
            <p>China represents another example of effective nation-level implementation. In 2022, over 5 million electric vehicles were sold in China, accounting for nearly 60% of all EVs sold globally. This rapid growth is the result of aggressive government policies and investment in infrastructure and manufacturing.</p>
            <p>The Netherlands provides a third example of strong policy alignment, with over 100,000 public charging ports and incentives for fleet electrification. EVs accounted for around 30% of all new car sales in 2022.</p>
            <p>These examples highlight the importance of national commitment. The United States has made progress but remains behind global leaders due to a more fragmented policy environment. However, recent initiatives such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 suggest a potential shift toward more comprehensive EV policy in the U.S.</p>
