      <h2>Journaling as Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        In <strong>Colostle</strong>, journaling is not a side activity—it <em>is</em> the game. Each time you draw cards to explore a new room or face a Rook, you receive a prompt rather than concrete instructions. It’s up to you, the player, to interpret that prompt and record the outcome in your journal. In this way, every encounter becomes a writing exercise, transforming simple card draws into a rich, personalized narrative.
      </p>

      <h3>Journaling Mechanics</h3>
      <p>
        - Draw cards during <em>Exploration</em> and (occasionally) <em>Combat</em> phases.<br>
        - Consult the prompt tables to learn what you’ve discovered or the challenge you face.<br>
        - Write a first‑person journal entry describing how your character interprets and responds to each prompt.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The official <em>Roomlander Journal</em> provides templates for card logs, maps, and space for freeform writing—emphasizing the journal as both record and creative canvas.
      </p>

      <h3>Handwritten vs Digital Journaling</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Handwritten Journals</strong>  
        <ul>
          <li>Offer a tactile, immersive experience—pen on paper encourages focus and presence.</li>
          <li>Slower pacing can deepen reflection and give space for sketches and marginalia.</li>
          <li>Physical pages reinforce the fantasy theme with textured paper and ink.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Digital Journals</strong>  
        <ul>
          <li>Enable rapid typing, easy editing, and seamless organization (search, copy/paste, hyperlinks).</li>
          <li>Allow multimedia integration—images, maps, even audio logs.</li>
          <li>Can be accessed from anywhere and shared online (e.g., blog posts or social feeds).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Both mediums are valid—choose whichever best supports your creative flow. Many players blend the two, handwriting key entries and later transcribing them digitally for safekeeping.
      </p>

      <h3>Reflective Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Journaling in <strong>Colostle</strong> offers more than just a fantasy diary: it’s a tool for self‑reflection and creative growth.  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Psychological research shows journaling can improve self-awareness and emotional integration.<br>
          (<a href="references.html#ref-faccio" target="_top">Faccio et al., 2019</a>)</li>
        <li>Writing your own prompts and scenes fosters narrative thinking and problem‑solving skills.</li>
        <li>The solitude of solo play creates a meditative space—every entry is both story and personal expression.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Personally, I tried both methods of play. I started with a physical journal for my adventures and then built a digital platform to continue my adventure on. I thoroughly enjoyed both experiences, but the tactile feel, time for reflection, and ability to organize thoughts better when physically journaling led to a better gameplay experience for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you sketch a map of the Roomlands in your margins or type a polished tale on a tablet, your journal becomes a unique artifact of your journey through Colostle’s endless corridors.
