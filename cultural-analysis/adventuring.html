      <h2>Adventuring: Exploration, Combat, and Solitude</h2>

      <h3>Exploration Structure</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Colostle</strong> is built around alternating phases of <em>Exploration</em> and occasional <em>Combat</em>. In each Exploration phase you draw cards and consult the prompt tables, which are organized by environment: the general Roomlands, the Indoor Oceans, the Cities, or the Battlements atop the walls. Each prompt is a narrative seed—perhaps a ruined library hall, a flooded courtyard, or a hidden alcove—and it’s your job to describe what your character discovers and how they react in your journal.

      <h3>Combat & Encounters</h3>
      <p>
        When you encounter a Rook—massive stone automatons that patrol the castle—you resolve combat with a simple card‑draw minigame. You and the Rook each draw cards; the higher draw wins the exchange, and wounds are recorded in your journal. Victories grant you Rook parts or magical Rookstones to harvest, fueling your character’s progression and story.

      <p>
        This light combat system is designed to spark vivid fight scenes in your writing rather than bog you down in rules. Every clash becomes a chance to craft an epic journal entry—dodging falling rubble in a grand ballroom or prying a glowing crystal from a defeated Rookling.
      </p>

      <h3>Solitude & Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        The heart of <strong>Colostle</strong> lies in solitary exploration. You are the lone adventurer in a castle so vast that even grand citadels and oceans fit beneath its vaulted ceilings. This solitude fosters both creativity and introspection: as you journey through endless corridors, your journal entries become a personal dialogue with the game world and yourself.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Research has shown that solo journaling can enhance self‑awareness and enrich narrative thinking. In playing <strong>Colostle</strong>, each turn is an opportunity not just to chronicle your character’s exploits but also to reflect on themes of identity, purpose, and discovery.

      </p>
      <p>
        The mix of light mechanics and open‑ended prompts turns the solitary solitary into something deeply engaging—your journal is both a record of adventure and a mirror for your own creativity.
