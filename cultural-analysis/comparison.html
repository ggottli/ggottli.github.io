      <h2>Comparison to Other Solo RPGs</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Thousand Year Old Vampire</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Thousand Year Old Vampire</em> (Tim Hutchings, 2020) chronicles an immortal vampire’s centuries‑long life through numbered prompts and a memory‑management mechanic. Its introspective, often melancholic tone and forced choices about which memories to retain create a tightly woven narrative arc about loss and identity. This contrasts with <strong>Colostle</strong>’s sandbox‑style exploration and open‑ended journaling, where the player freely crafts adventures in a whimsical castle world.

      <section>
        <h3>Journey</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Journey</em> (Luke Miller, 2022) is a worldbuilding solo RPG that guides players through creating their own fantasy settings via aspect‑based journaling prompts. Rather than leading a character through a plot, it helps writers flesh out cultures, histories, and magic systems. Like <strong>Colostle</strong>, it emphasizes creative freedom and narrative discovery, but its focus is on constructing the world itself rather than chronicling an adventurer’s exploits.

      <section>
        <h3>Carta‑Based RPGs</h3>
        <p>
          Carta‑based solo RPGs (Peach Garden Games, 2022) use a shuffled deck laid out as a map grid. Players navigate by moving a token between cards, revealing new locations and responding to prompts, with a defined goal card marking the end. This structure adds spatial choice and a clear objective, blending narrative journaling with puzzle‑like progression. In contrast, <strong>Colostle</strong> offers freeform roaming through its endless rooms, prioritizing story prompts over mapped exploration.

      <section>
        <h3>Where Colostle Fits</h3>
        <p>
          Together, these titles showcase the diversity of solo RPGs: from the introspective memory puzzles of Thousand Year Old Vampire, to Journey’s worldbuilding workshop, to Carta’s mapped adventures. <strong>Colostle</strong> carves out its niche as a whimsical, journal‑first exploration game—offering both a vivid setting and open‑ended narrative freedom for the solo player.
