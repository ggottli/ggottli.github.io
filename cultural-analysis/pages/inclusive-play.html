                            Another hallmark of modern board game design is a
                            focus on keeping all players involved until the end
                            of the game. This seems like such a simple idea, but
                            in many older competitive games, an unlucky/bad
                            player could be eliminated early (bankrupt in
                            Monopoly, wiped out in Risk, etc.). This player
                            would then be forced to sit and watch while everyone
                            else continued to play. This often led to boredom
                            and hurt feelings for the ousted players. Today’s
                            board games largely avoid strict player elimination.
                            It’s now common for everybody to get to play for the
                            entire duration, even if they’re behind in score. As
                            one commentator noted, “In many modern board games,
                            all players participate until the very end… That’s
                            true for co-operative as well as competitive games”.
                            This means no one has to watch the clock for an
                            hour, feeling left out of the fun. Games have tried
                            adapting to this new modern idea. Previous
                            elimination games like Werewolf, have rebranded the
                            narratology and rules to eliminate the elimination
                            aspect. Newer Eurogames, like Catan, really helped
                            introduce and popularize this idea in society.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The decline of player elimination ties into a
                            broader social value of inclusivity and
                            togetherness. Game designers recognize that people
                            play board games to socialize and have a good time
                            with friends or family. Eliminating someone part way
                            through completely undermines that social
                            experience. Instead, newer games find creative ways
                            to keep everyone in the game. Some competitive games
                            ensure that even if you’re losing, you still get to
                            take actions each turn and can enjoy the process.
                            Many games also employ comeback mechanics or scoring
                            systems that keep the final outcome uncertain until
                            the very end, so nobody feels “out” early. This also
                            allows players who are behind to get back in it,
                            keeping every round exciting. Even classic
                            elimination style genres have evolved. For example,
                            modern party games often have very short rounds or
                            ways for eliminated players to rejoin in the next
                            round, minimizing anyone’s downtime.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another change is in some modern games even the
                            losers get to accomplish something meaningful by the
                            end of play. In an old war-game like Risk or a duel
                            like Chess, the losing side is left with nothing.
                            Their army gets destroyed or their pieces captured.
                            But consider a popular modern game like Catan.
                            Although it’s small and seems insignificant, even a
                            player who comes in last will have built a couple of
                            settlements and roads, contributing to the island’s
                            development. They can look at the board and see
                            something they created, however modest, instead of
                            feeling like everything they did was wiped out. As
                            the board game video pointed out, a losing player in
                            Catan “will still have the settlement they placed
                            down – it might not be as impressive as the
                            winner’s, but it’s still something they’ve succeeded
                            at building”. This design philosophy means no one
                            walks away empty-handed. Psychologically, that’s a
                            big improvement that science shows improves the
                            overall experience of a game. It keeps players
                            happier and more willing to play again, because the
                            experience remains positive even in defeat. All
                            these inclusive design choices show how modern board
                            games emphasize engagement, fairness, and respect
                            for all players, reflecting a social shift toward
                            inclusive play where everyone has fun rather than a
                            harsh focus on single winners and losers.
