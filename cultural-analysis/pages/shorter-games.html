                            One of the most noticeable improvements in modern
                            games is their pacing and engagement. The classic
                            games of the past often dragged on for many hours or
                            had long stretches where players simply waited for
                            their turn. Games like Risk could take north of 8
                            hours depending on your play, an entire day's worth
                            of work on one game. In contrast, newer games tend
                            to be snappier and ensure that every turn is
                            interesting. One example is a game like Carcassonne
                            that usually takes around 30–45 minutes total. This
                            is a far cry from sessions of Monopoly that could
                            span the course of multiple days. This shorter
                            playtime means players can actually finish a game in
                            one sitting without losing steam, making the
                            experience more satisfying.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Crucially, modern games also strive to eliminate the
                            dull downtime that plagued older designs. In
                            Pandemic, a popular cooperative game, each player’s
                            turn involves important actions (treating diseases,
                            traveling to new cities, strategizing with
                            teammates) so that there’s always something
                            meaningful to do. By comparison, in a classic like
                            Clue, you might have turns where you simply can’t
                            make any progress because you’re stuck moving toward
                            a room, resulting in a whole turn “wasted.” This
                            wastes time and taints the gameplay experience.
                            Designers now recognize that having players sit idle
                            is a quick way to lose fun. Thus, they craft games
                            where every turn counts and each player remains
                            mentally involved throughout. Since every turn is
                            important, yours and the other players, everyone is
                            constantly engaged and participating. This shift
                            toward brevity and consistent excitement reflects a
                            cultural preference for experiences that respect our
                            time and keep us engaged.

                            It also is catering to the younger generation and
                            their shortened attention span. Modern players are
                            often adults with busy schedules or kids accustomed
                            to fast-paced media. These everyday people are far
                            less interested in four-hour slogs or waiting 15
                            minutes between turns. They want games that deliver
                            fun gameplay in a reasonable amount of time. The
                            popularity of quick but deep games (sometimes called
                            “filler games” or “gateway games”) attests to this
                            desire. Even traditionally longer game genres have
                            been streamlined and some have come out with
                            different versions geared towards quicker game
                            lengths. Even games like Chess which has recently
                            been mainstreamed during Covid has seen a huge rise
                            in popularity. A big change associated with this is
                            bullet (or rapid) chess where games can take less
                            than a minute. Many strategy board games now aim for
                            60–90 minute playtimes where possible. By trimming
                            the fat of boredom and endless length, contemporary
                            board games ensure a more inclusive and fun
                            experience for everyone at the table from start to
                            finish.
