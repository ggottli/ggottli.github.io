      <h2>Welcome to the Colostle</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Colostle</strong> is a solo tabletop role‑playing game set within an impossibly vast castle whose rooms contain oceans, mountains, and entire cities. You are the lone adventurer, forging your path through this surreal landscape of <em>Rooks</em> — giant living constructs imbued with magical Rookstones — using only a deck of playing cards, a journal, and your imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through <strong>journaling</strong>, you chronicle your character’s discoveries, trials, and triumphs, weaving the narrative of your personal saga. Each card draw serves as a prompt for an exciting encounter: a broken mechanism in a flooded corridor, the distant roar of a Rook, or the hidden secrets of a forgotten library.
      </p>
      <p>
        All you need to begin:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A pen or pencil and a notebook</li>
        <li>A standard deck of playing cards</li>
        <li>The spirit of adventure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Prepare your journal, shuffle your deck, and step into the Roomlands. Your adventure awaits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Colostle isn't a very well known or popular game, it still reflects a lot of cultural ideas and encapsulates what makes other games great into a small, solo campaign for all. Rather than analyzing Colostle's impact on culture, I will focus on how culture impacted the game and world of Colostle.
